xSnes Changelog:

v1.01 WIP
- Modified "About" information located in the UI Config-Advanced tab
- The readme.txt and the changelog.txt are now two separate files.
- Enabled "StartFullScreen" by defualt in "settings.bml", delete current
  "settings.bml" = %AppData%\xSnes to take effect! Doesn't work the way
  it should directly from UI library. Drag & Drop "Cartridge Folder" 
  to xSnes.exe only. Added to give example of current state.

- Initial Release

To be continued...
